The term portion of the compiler is fine, but several weeks of up-to-my-elbows
debugging, with some proress but no end yet in sight has made it painfully
clear that the handler portion of the compiler is a total cluster-fuck disaster.

For starters, here is a list of changes to make to the existing code, that
should hopefully simplify things:

  + parser and source syntax:

    - reactive resumptions are, in reality, pointers, and their dereferences
      need to be made explicit in both the concrete and the abstract syntax
      (unless we want to bring a type inferencer into the mix)

  + target syntax:

    - clear out all the redundant structures indicating resumptions;
      these will no longer be needed;

    - get rid of requests as a separate production; these should be made
      into ordinary constructor expressions;

  + module 'HCompile' and 'CodeGen':

    - get rid of all special-case productions for pattern-testing;

    - compile requests to ordinary constructor expressions;

  + interpreter:

    - redo it, with emphasis on a cleaner structure;

Implemented yesterday's list;

Traced problems in the execution of the output code to the fact that
not all relevant references are being pushed when recursive calls occur;
this results in inconsistent variable contents on return within the handler,
and ultimately leads to a number of control flow problems.

Fixing this by pushing all assigned variables on recursive call, and popping
them at the top of the fixpoint.
